# Flutter Setup Complete! 🎉

## ✅ What I've Done:

1. **Created `.zshenv` file** with Flutter PATH configuration
2. **Created `~/development` directory** for Flutter SDK
3. **Set up PATH** for both Flutter and CocoaPods

## 🚀 Quick Install Commands:

Run these commands in your terminal:

```bash
# 1. Download Flutter (choose based on your Mac type)
# For Apple Silicon (M1/M2/M3):
curl -O https://storage.googleapis.com/flutter_infra_release/releases/stable/macos/flutter_macos_arm64_3.32.4-stable.zip

# For Intel Mac:
# curl -O https://storage.googleapis.com/flutter_infra_release/releases/stable/macos/flutter_macos_3.32.4-stable.zip

# 2. Extract Flutter
unzip flutter_macos_*_3.32.4-stable.zip -d ~/development/

# 3. Remove the zip file
rm flutter_macos_*_3.32.4-stable.zip

# 4. Reload your terminal
source ~/.zshenv

# 5. Verify installation
flutter doctor
```

## 🏃‍♂️ Running the Playground:

Once Flutter is installed:

```bash
# Go to playground
cd /Users/jos/Developer/Fenrir/rive_playground

# Get dependencies
flutter pub get

# Run the app
flutter run -d chrome  # For web browser
# OR
flutter run           # For iOS simulator
```

## ⚡ Quick Terminal Tips:

- **New terminal windows**: Will automatically have Flutter in PATH
- **Current terminal**: Run `source ~/.zshenv` to update PATH
- **Check Flutter**: Run `which flutter` to verify it's found
- **Flutter help**: Run `flutter --help` for commands

## 🔍 Troubleshooting:

If `flutter` command not found:
1. Make sure you downloaded and extracted Flutter to `~/development/`
2. Run `source ~/.zshenv` in your terminal
3. Check if Flutter exists: `ls ~/development/flutter/bin/`

That's it! You're all set up. 🚀
